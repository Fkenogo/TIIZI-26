7.1 Exercise Categories
Plank Variations
1. Plank Right (partially visible at the top): Lie on your right side with your legs
straight and feet stacked. Prop yourself up on your right forearm or hand,
lifting your hips so your body forms a straight line. This isometric move
primarily targets the obliques and core stability.
2. Leg Up Side Plank Left: Start in a side plank on your left side. Once stable, lift
your top (right) leg toward the ceiling while keeping it straight. This variation
increases the intensity for your core and engages the hip abductors.
3. Leg Up Side Plank Right: Perform a side plank on your right side and lift your
top (left) leg. This helps balance muscle development on both sides of the
body while challenging your coordination.
4. Left Side Plank with Arm Raised: While holding a side plank on your left arm,
extend your right arm straight up toward the ceiling. This "T" shape helps
open up the chest and further challenges your balance and core engagement.
5. Right Side Plank with Arm Raised: Perform a side plank on your right arm and
reach your left arm vertically. This exercise strengthens the shoulders and

obliques while improving overall body alignment.
6. Side Plank with Left Leg Raised: In a right-side plank position, lift your left leg
straight up. This move focuses on the lateral chain, strengthening the side of
the torso and the outer hip.
7. Side Plank with Right Leg Raised: While in a left-side plank, raise your right
leg. This advanced movement requires significant core strength and stability
to keep the hips from sagging.
8. Push Up Hold: Get into a standard push-up position and lower your body until
your chest is just above the floor and your elbows are at a 90-degree angle.
Hold this bottom position to build immense isometric strength in the chest,
shoulders, and triceps.

Side Plank Variations
Kneeling Side Plank Left: Support your weight on your left forearm and left
knee (bent at 90 degrees), lifting your hips to form a straight line from head to
knees. This is a great modification for building initial side-core strength.
Kneeling Side Plank Right: Perform the kneeling plank on your right side. It
targets the right obliques while providing more stability than a full side plank.
Leg Up Side Plank Left: From a standard side plank on your left forearm, lift
your right leg straight up towards the ceiling. This significantly increases the
challenge for the hip abductors and core.
Leg Up Side Plank Right: Perform the leg-up variation on your right forearm,
lifting your left leg. This helps identify and correct strength imbalances
between sides.
Left Side Plank with Arm Raised: In a side plank on your left arm, extend your
right arm vertically. This improves shoulder stability and balance.
Right Side Plank with Arm Raised: Hold a side plank on your right arm and
reach your left arm up. This opens the chest and engages the entire lateral
chain.
Side Plank with Left Leg Raised: While in a side plank on your right side, lift
your left leg. This move emphasizes outer thigh and glute strength alongside
the obliques.

High Plank Variations
Leg Raised Plank Right: From a high plank (push-up) position, lift your right
leg straight back and up without arching your lower back. This engages the
glutes and hamstrings.
Diagonal Plank Hold Left: From a high plank, simultaneously lift your left arm
and right leg until they are parallel to the floor. This is an advanced balance
and stability exercise.
Diagonal Plank Hold Right: Lift your right arm and left leg from a high plank.
This "bird-dog" variation in a plank position requires intense core tension.
Plank with Left Arm Lift: Hold a forearm plank and extend your left arm
straight forward. This forces the rest of your core to work harder to prevent
the body from rotating.
Plank with Right Arm Lift: Perform the arm lift with your right arm from a
forearm plank. It builds shoulder and rotational core strength.
Single Left Leg Plank: Hold a standard forearm plank while keeping your left
foot lifted off the floor. This shifts more load onto the remaining three points of
contact.
Single Right Leg Plank: Hold a forearm plank with your right foot lifted. This is
a simple but effective way to increase plank intensity.

Core and Plank Stability
Knee Plank: A forearm plank where you rest on your knees instead of your
toes. It is the fundamental starting point for core training.
Reverse Plank: Sit with legs extended and hands behind you, then lift your
hips toward the ceiling. This targets the posterior chain: glutes, hamstrings,
and lower back.
Reverse Plank with Left Leg Raised: While holding a reverse plank, lift your
left leg straight up. This adds dynamic load to the supporting right leg and
glute.
Reverse Plank with Right Leg Raised: Lift your right leg during a reverse plank
to challenge the left side of your posterior chain.

Plank and Reach Left: From a high plank on your hands, reach your left arm
forward. This trains anti-rotational core stability.
Plank and Reach Right: Reach your right arm forward from a high plank. Focus
on keeping your hips level with the floor throughout the movement.
Leg Raised Plank Left: From a high plank, lift your left leg straight back to
engage the posterior muscles while maintaining a strong core.

Upper Body and Full Body Stability
Modified Push-Up Low Hold: On your knees, lower yourself into a push-up
and hold the position at the bottom. This builds great isometric strength in the
chest and arms.
Standing Biceps Stretch Left: Extend your left arm back and rotate the palm
away from your body, perhaps using a wall for leverage, to stretch the front of
the upper arm.
Standing Biceps Stretch Right: Repeat the stretch for your right arm to
maintain flexibility in the biceps and shoulders.
Seated Butterfly Stretch: Sit with the soles of your feet together and let your
knees drop outward. This stretch is excellent for opening up the hips and inner
thighs.
Squat Reach Ups: Perform a standard squat, and as you stand, reach both
arms overhead toward the ceiling in one fluid motion.
Wide Arm Plank: A high plank position with your hands placed significantly
wider than your shoulders, putting more emphasis on the outer chest.
Straight Arm Knee Plank: A high plank on your hands with your knees on the
ground. This is a common starting position for learning proper push-up form.

Lower Body and Flexibility
Left Quad Stretch with Wall: Standing on one leg near a wall for balance, grab
your left foot behind you and pull it toward your glute to stretch the front of the
thigh.

Right Quad Stretch with Wall: Perform the same quadriceps stretch for the
right leg.
Lying Butterfly Stretch: Lie on your back with the soles of your feet together,
letting gravity gently pull your knees toward the floor.
Standing Side Bend: Reach one arm overhead and lean your torso to the
opposite side to stretch the obliques and lateral muscles.
Lying Twist Stretch Left: Lying on your back, bring your knees toward your
chest and let them fall to the left side to stretch the lower back and outer hip.
Lying Twist Stretch Right: Let your knees fall to the right side for a spinal twist
that relieves tension in the lumbar region.
Alternating Hooks: Standing in an athletic stance, throw controlled "hook"
punches, rotating your hips and core with each strike.
Modified Push-Up: Push-ups performed with your knees on the ground to
reduce the amount of body weight you have to lift.

Stretches and Mobility
Cobra Stretch: Lying on your stomach, press your upper body up with your
hands while keeping your hips on the floor to stretch the abdominals and
chest.
Kneeling Lunge Stretch Left: Kneel on your right knee with your left foot
forward, then shift your weight forward to stretch the right hip flexor.
Kneeling Lunge Stretch Right: Shift forward with your right leg forward to
stretch the left hip flexor.
Calf Stretch Left: Stand with your left foot behind you and heel pressed into
the floor, leaning forward to stretch the lower leg muscles.
Calf Stretch Right: Repeat for the right leg.
Triceps Stretch Left: Reach your left hand down your back and use your right
hand to gently press on the left elbow.
Triceps Stretch Right: Perform the same stretch for the right triceps.

Spine and Hip Mobility
Tiizi MVP PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT (PRD)

8

Cat Cow Pose: Moving between an arched back (Cow) and a rounded back
(Cat) while on hands and knees to improve spinal flexibility.
Chest Stretch: Stand in a doorway or against a wall corner and lean forward
with an arm braced to stretch the pectoral muscles.
Child's Pose: Kneel and sit back on your heels while reaching your arms
forward on the floor. This is a deeply relaxing stretch for the entire back.
Shoulder Stretch: Pull one arm across your chest with the other arm to stretch
the posterior deltoid.
Single Leg Hip Rotation: Stand on one leg and lift the other knee, rotating it in
circles to improve hip joint mobility.
Spine Lumbar Twist Stretch Right/Left: Lying on your back, cross one knee
over your body to the opposite side to gently stretch the spine and hips.

Dynamic Movement and Leg Strength
High Stepping: March or run in place, bringing your knees up as high as
possible. This is a great cardio warm-up.
Side Plank Left: A standard side plank on the left forearm, keeping the body in
a rigid, straight line from head to heels.
Wall Sit: Lean your back against a wall and slide down into a seated position
with thighs parallel to the floor, holding for time to build leg endurance.
Butt Bridge: Lie on your back and lift your hips toward the ceiling. This is one
of the best exercises for isolating the glutes.
Skater Jump: Leap laterally from side to side, landing softly on one foot in a
motion that mimics a speed skater.
Side Hop: Perform small, quick jumps from side to side to improve agility and
lower leg power.
Butt Kicks: Run in place while actively trying to kick your heels back against
your glutes to warm up the hamstrings.

Compound Strength Exercises

Triceps Dips: Using a chair or bench, lower and lift your body weight with your
arms to target the back of the upper arms.
Step-Up Onto Chair: Step up onto a sturdy chair or platform with one leg and
drive through the heel to stand up fully, then step back down.
Push-Ups: The classic upper body exercise for chest, shoulders, and triceps,
maintaining a straight-body plank throughout.
Squats: A fundamental lower body move where you lower your hips back and
down, keeping your chest up and weight in your heels.
Push-Up & Rotation: Perform a push-up and, as you return to the top, rotate
into a side plank with one arm reaching high.
Lunges: Step forward and lower your back knee toward the ground,
maintaining an upright torso to work the quads and glutes.
Side Plank Right: A standard side plank held on the right forearm.

blades off the floor to target the upper rectus abdominis.
Plank: The foundational core stability exercise, held on the forearms and toes.
Reverse Crunches: Lying on your back, use your lower abs to curl your hips
off the floor, bringing your knees toward your chest.
Bird Dog: From all fours, extend your opposite arm and leg simultaneously to
improve balance and back strength.
Bridge: A variation of the butt bridge, focusing on holding a straight line from
knees to shoulders to engage the glutes.
Jumping Jacks: A full-body cardio classic that involves jumping feet wide
while swinging arms overhead.
Straight-Arm Plank: Also known as a high plank, this is the top position of a
push-up and builds great shoulder and core endurance.
